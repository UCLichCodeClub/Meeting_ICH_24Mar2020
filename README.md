# Meeting_ICH_24Mar2020

Ferrán González Hernández on Biomedical Natural Language Processing: Applications and Software

***Abstract***

With a growing volume of biomedical information reported in textual format, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become an essential technique to efficiently extract, integrate and exploit knowledge stored across extensive collections of unstructured text. From rule-based to machine learning approaches, this presentation will introduce the main concepts, methodology, and software behind NLP and discuss its potential applications in biomedical research.

This meeting is virtual - it will take place on MS Teams, look for the group ICH Coding Club.
